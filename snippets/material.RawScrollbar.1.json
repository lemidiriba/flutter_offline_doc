    "description": "This sample shows an app with two scrollables in the same route. Since by\ndefault, there is one [PrimaryScrollController] per route, and they both have a\nscroll direction of [Axis.vertical], they would both try to attach to that\ncontroller. The [Scrollbar] cannot support multiple positions attached to\nthe same controller, so one [ListView], and its [Scrollbar] have been\nprovided a unique [ScrollController].\n\nAlternatively, a new PrimaryScrollController could be created above one of\nthe [ListView]s.",
